# Agent Instructions

## Agent Skills

Repository-local Agent Skills are deployed to `.agents/skills/` by
[APM](https://github.com/microsoft/apm). Do not edit that generated directory
directly.

## APM-managed Skills

- `apm.yml` pins the selected public
  [aoirint/skills](https://github.com/aoirint/skills); `apm.lock.yaml` records
  their resolved commits and content hashes.
- The initial pin is an explicit maintainer-directed exception to the normal
  seven-day dependency cooldown so this repository can adopt the current Flet
  quality baseline immediately.
- To restore the committed Skill set, run `apm install --frozen` from the
  repository root, then run `apm audit --ci`.
- Make all Skill changes in the public
  [aoirint/skills](https://github.com/aoirint/skills) repository. This
  repository only selects, pins, and deploys those Skills.
- To update a Skill dependency, review its source, commit pin, license, and
  cooldown first. Update `apm.yml`, run `apm lock`, review `apm.lock.yaml`, run
  `apm install --frozen` and `apm audit --ci`, then commit the manifest,
  lockfile, and generated `.agents/skills/` changes together.

## Pull Request Merges

- Merge pull requests with squash merge.
- Before confirming the merge, set the squash commit title to
  `<pull request title> (#<number>)`, including the pull request number as in
  GitHub's default squash-merge title.
